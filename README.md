# Question Answering System-HackOn
This project implements a Question Answering (QA) System leveraging the powerful BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The system takes a passage of text as input and answers questions by understanding the context using deep learning-based NLP techniques.

BERT is a state-of-the-art transformer model that excels in understanding the nuances and context in natural language, making it ideal for question answering tasks.
